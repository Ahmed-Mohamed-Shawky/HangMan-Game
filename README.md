# 🎮 Hangman Game - Python Edition 🐍

Welcome to the **Hangman Game**, where you can test your guessing skills against a not-so-forgiving machine! 😜 Will you emerge victorious or end up... well, hanged? Let's find out!

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Choose a Category**: From Animals to Famous Landmarks, we've got 10 categories for you to guess from. Pick your favorite and let the challenge begin!
   
2. **Start Guessing**: The machine will show you a hidden word. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to guess the word one letter at a time.

3. **Watch Out**: If you guess wrong, the poor stick figure gets closer to meeting its unfortunate fate. 💀
